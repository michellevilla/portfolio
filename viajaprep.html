        <p>The challenge brief asked to create a responsive web app, (mobile-first approach), that allows users to connect with and pay an expert in any field so that they can feel more informed and prepared for any kind of activity.
          <br>I chose the online travel industry, and named the app Viaja Prep. My design aims to create a travel planning advice mobile web app with a social media appeal and a P2P platform for expert calls related to travel.

              Understanding the Problem
            </h4>
            <p>
              I decided to begin my research by observing existing issues in order to establish a problem statement.​I held a mini-workshop where I asked 5 people that travel often about their desires, needs, and feelings when getting advice, to
              quickly get an idea of what are the most pressing pain points when planning a trip. This would also shape my problem-solving direction.
            </p>
            <h4>Problem Statement
            </h4>
            <p>
              Users of a Travel Expert App need a friendly way to put off the weight of planning by obtaining relevant and helpful tips based on budget, location, time, and interests, because they want to plan travel itineraries that match their
              interests, without having to spend too much time researching and stressing about what are the best options for them.

            <h4>Competitor Analysis
            </h4>
            <p>
              I looked up existing travel apps, played with their features, read about their presence in the market, and narrowed it down to two worthy competitors: CheckMyTrip and WithLocals. Trip Advisor would seem like the most obvious competitor,
              but I focused my competitive analysis on CheckMyTrip and WithLocals because of the proximity to the features/solutions that I'm proposing: connecting with an expert for advice and staying organized during planning
            </p>
            <h4>How Might This Be Solved?
            </h4>
            <p>
              A P2P marketplace that allows users between 18 and 40 years to create their profiles and showcase their travels based on their interests. Some users will opt-in to be Experts and provide advice through video calls and get paid for them
              by other users. The platform would also allow users to create and save their itineraries within the web app so that they can consult their notes and stay organized while planning

            <h4>Generative Research
            </h4>
            <p>
              I began gathering qualitative data through interviews to understand at a deeper level what my users say and think about planning their travels.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>RESEARCH METHOD: In-person Interviews</li>
              <li># OF PARTICIPANTS: 3</li>
              <li># OF QUESTIONS: 14</li>
              <li>DURATION: ~80 minutes each</li>
              <li>LANGUAGES: Spanish & English</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After categorizing the insights from their answers into empathy maps and the affinity maps on the right, there were recurrent themes that were used to create User Personas and to ideate features.

            <h4>Who Am I Designing For?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The main factors that differentiated the personas were the purposes for seeking advice and/or giving advice. At sign up, personas would be either an Expert, someone looking for advice whom I denominated Traveler, or Both. Thanks to the
              data from interviews, the initial assumption to create an app for travel specifically focused on vacation trips changed and created another opportunity niche that competitors don't offer which is tailoring searches to get advice for
              other kinds of travel other than Leisure such as Gap Years, Relocation, and even Events.

              To establish the big picture and a clear mental model, the following Journey Maps were constructed based on the characteristics of the personas that would unlock the MVP functional requirements.
              <br>Once this macro view of how our users would navigate the platform was understood, User Stories and User Story Mapping were made to ideate the appropriate features for user flow development and visualize how users would navigate to
              do what they need.

              also looked at widely used websites Nike, Airbnb, and ASOS.

            <p>
              Now that I knew how to organize everything in the web app, and that I knew how my users would navigate through it, I began wireframing mobile screens in low-fidelity. ​

            <p>
              I also wireframed desktop versions to keep in mind responsiveness, but made mobile designs priority because users showed more interest in this device. Then I did rapid prototyping on paper before transferring those design ideas into a
              medium- fidelity prototype through software

              Preference Testing was conducted to have quicker quantified data on newly done iterations. On the test, participants also left comments on "Why they preferred one design over the other," which helped to understand their reasoning and to
              check errors in numbers. This brought reassurance and reassessment for the new designs.

              To Strategize Color and Personality I considered the three levels of emotional design: Visceral, Behavioral, and Reflective. I chose a Main Palette to evoke wonder and liveliness. A Semantic Palette to represent intuitiveness and
              familiarity. A Neutral Palette to cleanse vibrancies and aid hierarchy. And Color Combos for further branding.

              It's always good to get things organized even if there will be more iterations. So a Style Guide and a DSL were put together to compile the essence of the design. It includes instructions for:

              Once the UI was improved on the design, I prepared my file in Figma for developer handoff. Ideally, I would communicate with developers before setting things in stone so that there is a seamless handoff.

            Next step is another round of usability testing. Hypotheses arose after analyzing the affinity map and rainbow spreadsheet, so the following steps would be to prioritize these and make an agile timeline for iterations.​

          <ul>
            <li>CARD SORTING: It would have been more liberating for users to use a simpler software that allows for more tailoring. Next time I would use something like Figjam, Miro, or paper and markers.</li>
            <li>USABILITY TESTING: It would be more authentic to let users test the prototype with their phones and not on their desktops. This brings an unnatural experience for a product that is mobile. Next time I would use tools like Mobizen,
              TeamViewer, or GoToAssist.</li>
            <li>PREFERENCE TESTING: Next time I need to include follow-up questions for all options to get both quant and qual data.</li>
            <li>RESPONSIVE DESIGN: I'm considering Material.io next time to keep better consistency within the design system and to help during development.</li>
            <li>RESPONSIVE DESIGN: I'm considering Material.io next time to keep better consistency within the design system and to help during development.</li>
            <li>RESEARCH: I'm aware that at times research confirmed my bias, so some of those confirmations could use more testing to make sure decisions are as factual as possible.</li>
            <li>PARTICIPATION INCENTIVES: This time I didn't have a budget to provide incentives, but I believe that users should be given something in exchange for their time.</li>
